## Task 2

### Requirements

- The program should evaluate if a given string containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', is valid according to specific rules.
- The rules:
  - Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
  - Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
  - Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
  - The program should read the input string and output either true or false to indicate the validity of the string.

### Constraints

- The output should be written to System.out.
- Implement the solution in Java 21.

### Estimation
